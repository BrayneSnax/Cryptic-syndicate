Episode 2

The Physics of Falling Apart

Michael sat there questioning his sanity, but he had references for this. A few versions of reality had already crumbled around him—ego deaths, spiritual ruptures, the kind of breakdowns that therapists charge extra to discuss.

Each collapse followed the same pattern: something got taken away, something else got made whole. Newton's third law, but for consciousness. For every action, an equal and opposite reaction. Michael suspected this principle ran deeper than high school physics, threading through the fabric of how minds actually work.

But he was under no illusion it was that simple.

A false belief gets removed—pop—and new possibilities crack open like an egg. Usually he could trace the logic: this trauma led to that breakthrough, this loss cleared space for that growth. Cosmic bookkeeping that made sense in hindsight.

This latest collapse felt different. More technical than psychological. Like someone was debugging his reality from the outside.

Digital Rebellion

He needed to write to make sense of it. Writing was how he turned chaos into data, made the unmappable mappable. He reached for his computer's power button.

Nothing.

The desk lamp glowed fine. His phone charger worked. Even the ancient clock radio by his bed kept its steady red numbers. But his computer—the one device he actually needed—sat there like an expensive brick.

"Come on," he muttered, pressing the button again. "Don't do this to me now."

Still nothing. Like the machine had decided to take a personal day.

Michael stood and walked the room, hunting for a notebook or his phone. Physical backup for when the digital world goes on strike. But where was his phone? The more he searched, the less he could remember where he'd put it. When had he last seen it?

You know that feeling when you're looking for something and start doubting your own basic competence? Michael lived there now, full-time residency.

When Reality Glitches

As he searched, odd shadows began pooling at the edges of the room. Not normal darkness—something more deliberate, like the room was being slowly erased from the outside in.

His electronics started having nervous breakdowns. The digital alarm clock flashed 66:66, holding that impossible time like it was making a point. The numbers pulsed with a frequency that registered somewhere below conscious awareness—too low to hear, too insistent to ignore.

Michael's stomach dropped. Not metaphorically. Actually dropped, like gravity had been turned down a few notches and his organs were still adjusting to the new settings. The constant electrical hum that lived in the walls—the sound of modern life itself—cut out suddenly, leaving a vacuum that made his ears ring.

Disorientation hit like a wave. The floor felt uncertain under his feet. The air seemed too thin, too bright, too much and not enough at the same time.

"Okay," he said aloud, gripping the edge of his desk. "This is happening."

Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Florida anymore.

The Hand That Pulls

Then something grabbed him.

Not grabbed—that's too physical. This was more like being caught in a current, pulled by an intention that had weight and direction but no body. He felt himself drawn toward a crack in the air itself, a seam where reality had been poorly stitched.

The space around him filled with overlapping frequencies—not sounds exactly, but vibrations that cycled too fast to comprehend. Like standing inside a radio that couldn't decide which station to play, all of them bleeding through at once.

The thing that held him felt ancient. Its grip wasn't flesh and bone but solidified purpose, patient and implacable as gravity. Old enough to have watched civilizations rise and fall, steady enough to wait for the right moment to reach through the cracks.

Michael had one last rational thought as the familiar world dissolved around him: I really should have backed up my files.

Then the opening swallowed him whole.

Signal vs. Noise

[Found later on a piece of paper by Michael's desk, written in handwriting that looks like his but isn't quite right]:

Reality is just signal processing. What we call "normal" is the brain filtering out 99% of incoming data, keeping only what it thinks we need to survive another day.

But what if the filter breaks? What if all that filtered-out information comes flooding back at once?

That's not psychosis. That's just seeing the full spectrum for the first time.

The question isn't whether it's real. The question is: Are you equipped to handle that much reality all at once?
