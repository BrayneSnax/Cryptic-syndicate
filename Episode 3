 Episode 3

 The Weight of Nothing

Michael checked his surroundings the way you might check your pockets after a pickpocket bumps into you—methodically, looking for what might be missing.

Everything felt different. Lighter. The ineffable density that had weighed him down his entire life—that constant pressure he'd never had words for—had simply evaporated. Gone like fog burning off in morning sun.

Gravity worked differently here. Walking felt like effortless floating, like moving through warm water instead of thick air. His lungs filled easier. His thoughts moved faster. Even his diabetic body, usually sluggish and unreliable, hummed with unfamiliar energy.

This is what normal people must feel like, he thought. This is what it's like when reality isn't actively working against you.

He looked around and saw... people. Except not exactly people. Hominids of different types—some tall and angular, others compact and crystalline. The diversity reminded him of a Star Wars cantina, but without the costumes. This was just Tuesday for them.

They all lived under a massive dome that curved overhead like a cathedral made of light and mathematics.

 The Hand Behind the Curtain

After processing this flood of input—Okay, new reality, different physics, alien roommates, got it—Michael finally noticed the strong hand still resting on his back. The same grip that had ripped a hole in spacetime to place him here.

The touch felt like solidified intention and nothing more. Ancient purpose made tactile.

He turned to face his guide and nearly choked.

The face bore a striking resemblance to his own, but aged by wisdom and experience that showed most clearly in the eyes. Like looking at himself after living several lifetimes he hadn't earned yet.

The serious expression broke into a grin. "Yo, Mikey, what's good? It's me, Brayne Snax."

Michael's brain performed an emergency reboot.

Brayne Snax. The pseudonym he'd been using for artistic projects for years. The name that lived on album covers and story credits, in the margins of notebooks and the corners of his imagination.

Standing here. Talking to him. Looking like his older, wiser brother.

 The Skeptic's Last Stand

The ever-present skeptic in Michael's head grabbed the microphone and started shouting objections. Even with inexplicable evidence standing right in front of him, his rational mind refused to surrender.

"So I'm assuming this is a psychotic break," he said, voice steadier than he felt, "immersing me in a project I've been working on for years?"

Good, he thought. Maintain critical thinking. Don't let the hallucination win.

Brayne replied without missing a beat, like he'd been expecting the question. "Not exactly, although I understand that perspective. More accurately, your projects have been translations of seeds I've snuck into your subconscious reality-processing mechanisms."

Michael felt something crack behind his sternum. "You mean to tell me all my creative efforts haven't actually been mine? They're a time-travel project? That's the logic you're trying to convince me with?"

Because if that's true, his inner voice whispered, then what part of you was ever really you?

Brayne's tone softened, patient as a teacher explaining basic math to a frustrated student. "Your translations have been completely yours, man. The way you tend the seeds and harvest their fruits—that's free will in action. Your revelations and understandings have mystified the Syndicate for centuries."

"Mystified the Syndicate?" Michael's voice cracked. "What Syndicate?"

But he was too psychologically disoriented to process the answer. Questions piled up faster than he could ask them. The comfortable, effortless feeling of this new reality was consuming almost all his mental bandwidth—like trying to hold a conversation while floating in a sensory deprivation tank.

 Headquarters

Brayne picked up on his confusion and motioned for him to follow. They walked through streets that looked almost normal, if you ignored the fact that some of the residents had crystalline skin and others seemed to be made of organized light.

Finally they arrived at what Brayne called "Syndicate Headquarters." The building looked different from the others they'd passed—bigger, older, more intentional. Sigils and alchemical symbols were etched into each stone block, and each symbol seemed to emit its own subtle psychic field.

Michael approached with the kind of apprehension you feel walking into a job interview that might change your entire life.

The symbols pulsed gently, like a heartbeat made of meaning. Standing near them felt like being close to a massive generator—you couldn't hear it, but you could feel the power humming in your bones.

Brayne didn't say anything aloud. Instead, his voice appeared directly in Michael's mind, clear as his own thoughts but distinctly not his own:

Enter.

Michael looked at the door—heavy wood carved with spirals that seemed to move when you weren't looking directly at them.

This is it, he thought. The moment I either get answers or lose my mind completely.

He reached for the handle.

 Reality Check

[Note found later, tucked between pages of Michael's notebook]:

If you're reading this and wondering whether any of it's real: wrong question. 

Better question: What does "real" even mean when your pseudonym starts having conversations with you?

Maybe reality isn't about what's true. Maybe it's about what's useful.

And maybe—just maybe—the universe has been trying to get your attention for a long time, and this is just the first method that finally worked.

—Someone who used to be skeptical

Reader's Note: Still following along? Good. Because if Michael's pseudonym can have its own life, what does that say about the characters you've been creating? Might want to check behind you. Just in case.
