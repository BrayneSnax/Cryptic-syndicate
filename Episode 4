 First Contact

As soon as Michael stepped through the door of Syndicate headquarters, something inside him clicked into place. Like a radio finally finding its frequency after years of static.

Coherent resonance—that's what Brayne would call it later. But in the moment, Michael just felt his internal state become the strongest voice in his head, louder than doubt, louder than analysis, pushing his mind and body toward something that felt suspiciously like trust.

Still, a corner of his brain refused to surrender. That skeptical part of him kept running calculations: Impossibility 1: Interdimensional travel. Impossibility 2: Meeting my own pseudonym. Impossibility 3: Feeling better than I have in years.

The math didn't add up. But his nervous system had already voted, and it was a landslide in favor of whatever this is, keep going.

 The Enhanced

Michael followed Brayne almost mindlessly through corridors lined with people who looked like they'd stepped out of a transhumanist fever dream. 

Some had crystalline enhancements growing from their temples—not implants exactly, more like their skulls had decided to sprout gemstones. Others moved with the fluid grace of dancers who'd figured out how to bend physics. One woman sat in lotus position three feet off the ground, apparently meditating so hard she'd forgotten about gravity.

Each person seemed absorbed in their own self-improvement modality. Yoga that involved folding through dimensions. Meditation that looked like controlled epilepsy. Martial arts practiced against invisible opponents who might have been fighting back.

It's like a spiritual gym, Michael thought, if spiritual gyms were designed by people who'd never heard the word 'impossible.'

 The Mantra

Brayne's developed clairsentience—his ability to read emotional weather patterns—picked up Michael's vulnerability like a barometer sensing an incoming storm. But his intention felt benevolent, like a therapist who genuinely wants to help rather than just collect fees.

"I have a grounding mantra I'd like you to experiment with," Brayne said, his voice carrying the authority of someone who'd guided others through this particular brand of reality adjustment before. "Follow me and listen to 'Return.'"

They found a quiet corner. Brayne's voice shifted into something deeper, more rhythmic. Not quite singing, not quite speaking. Like a meditation teacher who'd learned to make words into medicine:

---

Return

Breathe in.
Let it rise.
The hum is not noise—
It is memory, unwinding.

Breathe out.
Let it fall.
The weight you carried
Was never yours at all.

Feet on ground.
Mind in sky.
You are the still point
As the wires pass by.

Thoughts flicker—let them.
Sounds echo—bless them.
You are the observer
Between pulse and pattern.

You do not have to fix.
You only have to feel.
Each breath is a signal:
You're allowed to heal.

 The Click

Something extraordinary happened as the words settled into Michael's nervous system.

Dissonance clicked into harmony. Like a massive, cosmic tuning fork had been struck somewhere in his chest, and suddenly every frequency in his body remembered how to sing the same song.

His capacity for holding paradox expanded—not gradually, but exponentially, like a computer suddenly upgraded with infinite processing power. The part of him that needed everything to make logical sense relaxed its death grip on reality. The part of him that had been fighting the impossibility of his situation finally agreed to a ceasefire.

This is happening, he realized. I don't need to understand it. I just need to not break it.

Brayne had primed him to coherently hold the totality of his situation: interdimensional refugee, diabetic mystic, writer whose fictional characters had turned out to be documentary subjects.

The next challenge would be integration—figuring out how to take action in this new reality without cracking the underlying fundamentals that held it all together. Learning to move without breaking the spell.

Because some kinds of healing, Michael was beginning to understand, happen not when you figure everything out, but when you finally stop trying to.

 Field Notes from the Other Side

[Found later on letterhead marked "Cryptic Syndicate - Internal Memo"]:

Subject: First Contact Protocol - Success

New arrival (designation: Michael/Anchor) has achieved primary resonance. Grounding mantra "Return" effective. Paradox tolerance expanded to acceptable levels.

Next Phase: Action integration without reality fracture. 

Note: Subject's skeptical subroutines remain active but non-interference. This is optimal. Total belief creates different problems.

Recommendation: Proceed with standard orientation sequence. Subject appears ready for deeper protocols.

—Brayne Snax, Integration Specialist

Reader's Note: If that mantra worked on you while reading it, you might want to pay attention. Sometimes the medicine finds you before you know you need it. And if you're feeling more grounded after reading words that technically shouldn't be able to ground you... well, welcome to the Syndicate.
