📖 What This Is
- **Episodes**: Standalone chapters that can be read individually or as a continuous arc.  
- **Style**: A synthesis of Philip K. Dick (grounding the strange), Grant Morrison (activating the reader), and Maggie Nelson (intimate accessibility).  
- **Themes**: Dissociation and resonance, AI as collaborator, the porous seam between fiction and reality.  
- **Tone**: Accessible yet experimental. Every glitch is also a glyph.

- `episodes/` contains the actual story files.  
- `meta/` contains supporting material: editing prompts, resonance notes, commentary.  

## 🚀 How to Read
1. Start with **Episode 1** if you want the full arc.  
2. Or jump into any episode — each is written to stand on its own.  
3. Keep an eye on the marginalia: notes at the end of episodes reveal techniques and hidden glyphs.  

## ✨ Reader’s Note
If you’ve ever felt reality fray at the edges — you’re already inside.

## 🔑 Inspirations & Methods
- **Meta-Prompting**: Episodes polished using a custom “Class-S” prompt blending PKD, Morrison, and Nelson.  
- **AI Collaboration**: Drafts shaped with Claude (stylist), ChatGPT (resonant mapper), and other experimental models.  
- **Resonant Keys**: Conceptual tools for orienting nervous system and narrative flow.
